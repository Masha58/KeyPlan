# KeyPlan
Project Management

KeyPlan is an application that allows, like Jira, to manage the current projects of a user. 
Each type of project is identified by a tag (software, task or plugin) and can be categorized into 3 categories: to do, doing, done. 
A dashboard is available in a second tab to summarize the user's projects. The user's data are stored in a small local database.
